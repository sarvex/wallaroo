Installation Instructions
*************************

Requirements
============

Wallaroo relies on a couple of Boost libraries *only* if
- your application is compiled with a *non* C++0x compliant compiler OR
- XmlConfiguration and JsonConfiguration wallaroo features are used.

If you need Boost libraries, you can donwload the
latest version from www.boost.org, extract it wherever you want
and include its path when compiling your application that use Wallaroo.
Since Wallaroo uses header-only boost libraries, you don't need to compile
boost.

If you use a C++0x compliant compiler, you only need Boost to exploit
XmlConfiguration and JsonConfiguration features.

Installation
============

Wallaroo library is header-only: it consists entirely of header files
containing templates and inline functions, and require no separately-compiled
library binaries or special treatment when linking.

Extract the archive wherever you want.
This is a sketch of the resulting directory structure:

wallaroo\ .......................................The “wallaroo root directory”
   README ................................Generic documentation about wallaroo
   INSTALL .........................................Installation documentation
   ChangeLog ...........................................The log of the changes
   Version ..............................This file contains the version number
   wallaroo\ ........................................All Wallaroo Header files
   samples\ .................................................Examples and test
      minimal\.................................................A basic example
      cpp0x_only\.....................This example uses C++0x instead of boost
      boost_only\.....................This example uses boost instead of C++0x
      mineplant\ ............A "control system" example using XmlConfiguration
      roulette\.A roulette simulation, using multiple catalogs and shared libs
      shapes\.....A drawing sample, using XmlConfiguration & JsonConfiguration
      ...more samples...
   test\ ............ Automatic tests of the library (for wallaroo developers)
   doc\ .....................................A subset of Wallaroo library docs

Now you must only remember to insert the wallaroo path when compiling your
source code.
If you are using a compiler that doesn't support C++0x, or if you plan to
use the "XmlConfiguration" or "JsonConfiguration" features, you must also
include the Boost Libraries path.

Usage
=====

To build your own project, the compiler needs to know the include path of
the wallaroo and boost (optional) libraries.

So, if you use gcc, you can use the following syntax:
	g++ -I<boost_path> -I<wallaroo_path> *.cpp -o <app_exe>
or:
	g++ -std=c++0x -I<wallaroo_path> *.cpp -o <app_exe>
(You may need to add the linker -ldl option, if you use share libraries)
    
If you use Visual Studio:
    cl /EHsc /I<wallaroo_path> /I<boost_path> /Fe<app_exe> *.cpp
(you need the boost path only if you use visual studio 2008 or if you use
one of XmlConfiguration or JsonConfiguration classes).

To compile anything in Wallaroo, you need a directory containing the wallaroo\
subdirectory in your #include path.

Since all of Wallaroo's header files have the .h extension, and live in the
wallaroo\ subdirectory of the wallaroo root, your Wallaroo #include directives
will look like:
  #include <wallaroo/whatever.h>
or
  #include "wallaroo/whatever.h"
depending on your preference regarding the use of angle bracket includes.
Even Windows users can (and, for portability reasons, probably should) use
forward slashes in #include directives; your compiler doesn't care.


Compilation of the samples
==========================

You can find some examples in the directory samples. Each example comes with:
* GNU makefile
* Windows makefile (nmake)
* Visual Studio 2013 Solution File

Where needed (i.e., C++98 compiler or samples using XmlConfiguration/JsonConfiguration
features) you can specify the boost library path in the following ways:

* GNU Make
        make CXXFLAGS=-I<boost_path>
    example:
        make CXXFLAGS=-I/opt/boost_1_50_0/

* Windows nmake
    Set the environment variable BOOST.
    Then, from a visual studio console, use the command:
        nmake /f makefile.win32

* Visual Studio 2013 Solution File
    Set the environment variable BOOST.

Compilation of the Doxygen documentation
========================================
If you have doxygen installed on your system, you can get the html documentation
of the library in this way:
    <enter the directory doc>
    doxygen Doxyfile
