Introduction
============

Wallaroo is a lightweight yet powerful library for configurable creation
and wiring of C++ classes

With Wallaroo you will be able to separate the setup phase (object building
and wiring) from the logic of your classes. In addition, you will be able to
change the class of your objects without rebuilding anything: in this way you
can modify the behaviour of your application, or perform mock testing using
the same executable.

With Wallaroo you will be able to focus on the logic of your classes, without
worrying about the wiring phase.

This mechanism is called Dependency Injection (DI). Someone calls it
Inversion of Control (IoC), but actually that has a broader meaning. 


Key features
============

- Lightweight but powerful
- Type Safe
- DSL syntax for object creation and wiring
- Object creation and wiring also by parsing one (or more) xml or json file
- Shared library support
- C++11 or boost interface
- Doesn't use code generators


Installation
============

See INSTALL for (generic) installation instructions.
